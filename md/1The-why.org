* The WHY
I talk quite a lot.

From the sum if it, sometimes and /some things come out somewhat useful/.

Same thing with writing. I do write even more.

Some of it evolves into blog posts, but most of it just lie here, in my computer. But that is its main problem. If you have a trail of thought, its end goal should never be a blog post. It could just be, in its raw, unedited form. That trail of thoughs is the /main reason of this space/.

I won't lie, I was highly inspired by Joel in [[https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more]['Stop Giving af and Start Writing More']] and that is exactly how I will be doing. He has a perspective of creating a [[https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden]['digital garden']] for his own thoughts which I highly share ðŸŒ».

Not sure if it'll be somewhat useful for anyone. But I guess, not everything has to be useful, just to be fun, right?ðŸ¤”

And that is my type of garden ðŸ‘‡ I'll be planting in this garder
