# The WHY

I to talk a lot.

From the sum if it, sometimes and *some things come out somewhat useful*.

Same thing with writing. I do write even more.

Some of it evolves into blog posts, but most of it just lie here, in my computer. But that is its main problem. If you have a trail of thought, its end goal should never be a blog post. It could just be, in its raw, unedited form. That trail of thoughs is the *main reason of this space*.

I won&rsquo;t lie, I was highly inspired by Joel in [&rsquo;Stop Giving af and Start Writing More&rsquo;](https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more) and that is exactly how I will be doing. He has a perspective of creating a [&rsquo;digital garden&rsquo;](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) for his own thoughts which I highly share ðŸŒ».

Not sure if it&rsquo;ll be somewhat useful for anyone. But I guess, not everything has to be useful, just to be fun, right?ðŸ¤”
