# About me

I&rsquo;m not particularly interesting person. However I do have a hobby to code. That really has a good transition to various technologies and tools as a side effect.

At [work](https://ito.lt/) I specialize on mobile devices, in particular - Android. Mostly working with native technologies, though had opportunities to touch Flutter, NDK or trying out some hybrid in between.

But above all, my ♥ lies close to JVM technologies - Spring Boot 🍀, JavaFX, Kotlin, Gradle 🔧. And some experimentation on cryptic and unpredictable tech - TensorFlow, OpenCV, OCR 👀. Somehow I always find myself caught up mixing ant matching that tech in creating bots 🤖‍.

Also, I work with similiar-like-minded people at [iTo](https://ito.lt/). Some, if not bigger part of interesting engineering comes from there. Fingerscrossed 🤞 I&rsquo;ll be able to open-source some of the tools from there as well.

Above all the tech, I do rant a lot. But if you&rsquo;re still reading this, you probably have figured that out already. Who writes about himself that much ?? 🤦

*Anyway*. I was hoping that my love for tech and random garble would translate into something more useful.

*So*. You&rsquo;ll find blog posts and tools in the menu on the 👈
