I don&rsquo;t really see tutorials, that you would get in trouble when trying to display items in a list. But things get dicey when you start to apply a bit more complicated strategies for your use case.

For instance, have you tried using `ConcateAdapter` using adapters in a multiple span `GridLayoutManager`? Or just simply, using a regular `RecyclerView.Adapter` with `GridLayoutManager` to display items with separators instead of paddings?

For the last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve seen quite a bit of adapters. So I wanted to share some of the take-aways ü§∑


# Double separator issue

Applying backgrounds to `RecyclerView.Adapter` items is *simple enough*. So where is the problem?

Well, as always, *it depends*. If you have a list, where items are separated, there is no problem at all.

![img](imgs-merge-bg-grid/76AF33C7-04FC-42B1-80E9-407E18E0EC2A.png)

However it starts to be an issue, whenever the items become much closer. So close, as like having <span class="underline">no padding at all</span>. Then this happens üëá

![img](imgs-merge-bg-grid/422EDBB1-604B-4223-9514-055F39128275.png)

You get &rsquo;double lines&rsquo; as separators. And this was what I was actually aiming for üëá

![img](imgs-merge-bg-grid/goal.png)

How do we solve it? Well, few solutions, that come to mind. We either have to <span class="underline">change backgrounds</span> or use <span class="underline">separators</span> that `RecyclerView` supports.


# Using separators (failed attempt)

I&rsquo;ll say from the get-go, this did not work out for me after a couple of tries. If you&rsquo;re here only for the solution, move a bit downward.

At first, separators seem like a go-to solution. Actually, even the name tells us as much ü§∑.

It may seem to fix our problem, right? Well, **no**. This does not work, when trying to use it in `RecyclerView` + `GridLayoutManager`.

First problem is that &rsquo;separators&rsquo; are applied to the whole `RecyclerView`. So if you have `GridLayoutManager` with grid span of 2+, it would <span class="underline">apply separator to the whole section</span>.

Problem #2, when you apply separators, <span class="underline">it applies only in the direction you are separating the items</span>. If you would try to modify the `RecyclerView` with `MaterialDividerItemDecoration`, it has no problem when scrolling in provided direction. However, it does if you would try to draw &rsquo;separators&rsquo; on the direction, where the items do not scroll.

Last nail in the coffin ‚ö∞Ô∏è was when or if you&rsquo;re using `ConcatAdapter`. I won&rsquo;t go into too much detail, but this majorly breaks most of what you wanted to achieve.

Even though I was not able to use seperators on my use-case. But I can&rsquo;t deny, <span class="underline">it was a good learning experience</span>. [You can even try out using my updated separator if you wish so, as a starting point if you&rsquo;re adventorous enough](https://gist.github.com/marius-m/c8e39761bf054d645b548cd4f63a13c4). It is heavily &rsquo;insipred&rsquo; by `MaterialDividerItemDecoration`.


# Using different backgrounds (success üôå)

In some sense, this seems a bit counterintuitive and a more complicated solution than it should be. And I still think *this is the case*. However I did manage to get a working solution, that I&rsquo;m quite happy about it. At least for now.


## The trick

The whole idea is simple.

-   We provide a different background to a cell, depending where the cell is.
-   The trick, is to provide a background line where only it is needed

This is a bit difficult to explain in words, so I&rsquo;ll try to call my drawing superpowers ü¶∏.


## Moving to the 1st item

It&rsquo;s important to know <span class="underline">where is the first row</span> and <span class="underline">where is the first item in the column</span>. For the first item we provide a background, which has all the corners drawn, like so.

## Android shapes and sizes

Oh, and almost forgot. **This is how you provide a background using Android shapes**. You&rsquo;ll need this, if you would like to control how you would draw different backgrouds with provided borders.

-   Declare an xml with a `shape` in `{project}/app/src/main/res/drawable/shape.xml`
    
    ```xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
          <item>
              <shape>
                  <padding android:left="1dp" android:top="1dp" android:right="1dp" android:bottom="1dp"/>
                  <solid android:color="@color/cardStroke" />
              </shape>
          </item>
          <item>
              <shape>
                  <solid android:color="@color/cardBackground" />
              </shape>
          </item>
      </layer-list>
    ```
-   And use that background on any container (`ViewGroup`)
    
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:background="@drawable/shape_ll_basic">
    
        <!-- ‚òùÔ∏è Declated background-->
    
        <... xml content ... />
    
    </FrameLayout>
    ```


## Moving to the üëâ..

Next, we should define background for the item next to it. But, because <span class="underline">we already have a left bar in the background, we should append only top, bottom and right bars</span>. Like so üëá

![img](imgs-merge-bg-grid/0_1.png)

You&rsquo;re probably starting to *catch the drift*, how we&rsquo;re composing these backgrounds, by only appending bars only where it is needed.

The coolest part about it, if we would have more items to the right, we would only need to apply the same background - <span class="underline">top, bottom and right bars</span>. Like so

![img](imgs-merge-bg-grid/0_merge.png)


## Moving to the üëá

Alright, now that we know how to display whole row, we need to move downwards.

Once again, the most important thing, is to know <span class="underline">which item is first</span>. As we know, that this is not the first row, we already have a top bar. So, what we need is <span class="underline">left, right, bottom bars</span>.

![img](imgs-merge-bg-grid/1_0.png)

And the rest of the items on the right would require only <span class="underline">left and bottom, as we already have a top and left bars</span>.

![img](imgs-merge-bg-grid/1_1.png)

And this works really well, for the rest of the items as well, if we would provide more items in the grid üëá

![img](imgs-merge-bg-grid/1_merge.png)


## The code

Now that we know basic premise what we&rsquo;re aiming for, lets see how do we implement the `RecyclerView.Adapter`. The coolest part, is that there not much of logic here. As stated before, we only need to figure out

-   Is item in the first row
    
    ```kotlin
    private fun isItemInFirstRow(pos: Int): Boolean {
        return pos <= gridSpanSize - 1
    }
    ```
-   Is the item first in column
    
    ```
    private fun isItemInFirstColumn(pos: Int): Boolean {
        return pos % gridSpanSize == 0
    }
    ```

The rest of the adapter looks nothing out of ordinary.

```kotlin
class MergeAdapter<T : BasicAdapterItem>(
    private val gridSpanSize: Int,
    private val itemClickListener: ((BasicAdapterItem) -> Unit)? = null,
) : RecyclerView.Adapter<MergeAdapterViewHolder<T>>(), ItemBoundableAdapter<T> {

    override var items: List<T> by Delegates.observable(emptyList()) { _, oldList, newList ->
        autoNotify(oldList, newList) { o, n -> o.id == n.id }
    }

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(
        viewGroup: ViewGroup,
        viewType: Int
    ): MergeAdapterViewHolder<T> {
        return MergeAdapterViewHolder.create(viewGroup)
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(
        holder: MergeAdapterViewHolder<T>,
        position: Int,
    ) {
        val isItemInFirstRow = isItemInFirstRow(position)
        val isItemInFirstColumn = isItemInFirstColumn(position)
        val item = items[position]
        holder.bind(
            isItemInFirstRow,
            isItemInFirstColumn,
            item,
            itemClickListener
        )
    }

    /**
     * @return item position is in the first row
     */
    private fun isItemInFirstRow(pos: Int): Boolean {
        return pos <= gridSpanSize - 1
    }

    /**
     * @return item position is in the first column, when on different rows
     */
    private fun isItemInFirstColumn(pos: Int): Boolean {
        return pos % gridSpanSize == 0
    }

    override fun getItemCount(): Int = items.size
}
```

Now we provide the resolved properties to the `ViewHolder` to take care of drawing items.

-   Snippet to apply the background
    
    ```kotlin
     /**
     * Provides diff background based on item position in the grid
     * @param isFirstRow item is in the first row of the grid
     * @param isFirstColumn item is in the first column of the row
     */
    @DrawableRes
    private fun bgResourceByPosition(
        isFirstRow: Boolean,
        isFirstColumn: Boolean,
    ): Int {
        return when {
            isFirstRow && isFirstColumn -> R.drawable.shape_ll_merge_row_column_first
            isFirstRow && !isFirstColumn -> R.drawable.shape_ll_merge_row_column_last
            isFirstColumn -> R.drawable.shape_ll_merge_column_first
            else -> R.drawable.shape_ll_merge_column_last
        }
    }
    ```
-   Rest of the `ViewHolder` is nothing out of ordinary
    
    ```kotlin
    class MergeAdapterViewHolder<T : BasicAdapterItem>(
        private val binding: ItemMergedBinding,
    ) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(binding.root) {
    
        fun bind(
            isFirstRow: Boolean,
            isFirstColumn: Boolean,
            item: T,
            itemClickListener: ((T) -> Unit)?
        ) {
            val viewClickListener = toViewClickListenerOrNull(item, itemClickListener)
            binding.root.setOnClickListener(viewClickListener)
            binding.title.text = item.title
            binding.root.setBackgroundResource(bgResourceByPosition(isFirstRow, isFirstColumn))
        }
    
        /**
         * Provides diff background based on item position in the grid
         * @param isFirstRow item is in the first row of the grid
         * @param isFirstColumn item is in the first column of the row
         */
        @DrawableRes
        private fun bgResourceByPosition(
            isFirstRow: Boolean,
            isFirstColumn: Boolean,
        ): Int {
            return when {
                isFirstRow && isFirstColumn -> R.drawable.shape_ll_merge_row_column_first
                isFirstRow && !isFirstColumn -> R.drawable.shape_ll_merge_row_column_last
                isFirstColumn -> R.drawable.shape_ll_merge_column_first
                else -> R.drawable.shape_ll_merge_column_last
            }
        }
    
        companion object {
            fun <T : BasicAdapterItem> create(viewGroup: ViewGroup): MergeAdapterViewHolder<T> {
                return MergeAdapterViewHolder(
                    binding = ItemMergedBinding.inflate(
                        LayoutInflater.from(viewGroup.context),
                        viewGroup,
                        false
                    )
                )
            }
        }
    }
    ```

As always, if the code snippets are not enough, [check out sample app on github and try it yourself](https://github.com/marius-m/merged-bg-grid-adapter)! It has basic adapters, adapters with paddings and merged background adapters (what we were trying to do here) to try out üí™.


# Ending notes

Now. This is not exactly *rocket science* for sure. However I did not think twice, when picking up the task. Only by starting to dig deeper, I have found out, how many parts I need to figure out first, for the designs to be accurate.

Hopefully this will be useful for you as well and you won&rsquo;t need to spend so much time as I did ü§∑üöÄ.
